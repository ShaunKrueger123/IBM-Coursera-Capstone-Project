Both of these cities are located in the prairie provinces of Canada and while less than 600 km separates them each views themselves as the superior prairie city. I am hoping to use 4 square to see if it is possible to determine which city has more amenities to offer and where in the cities are the best place to live for variety. This report may help people decide which city is nicer to live in and what area of the city they may most enjoy being in."

Winnipeg is significantly larger than Regina though surprisingly they have a very similar number of entries in foursquare. I believe that the lack of information in foursquare for these cities very much limits how useful the report will be and in a future version I would like to see out other options that may have more information. If I was doing an even more in depth analysis I would find it interesting to include average housing prices and crime rates to the cities to get a more well rounded view of what is going on in each place."
